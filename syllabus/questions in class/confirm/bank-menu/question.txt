Banking System Program

A bank is a financial institution involved in borrowing and lending of money. With advancement in technology, online banking, also known as internet banking, allows customers of a bank to conduct a range of financial transactions through the bank’s website anytime, anywhere.

Two basic operations performed in an account are Deposit and Withdrawal.

Write a menu-driven program that:
	•	Accepts either of the two choices: Deposit or Withdrawal
	•	Accepts an amount
	•	Performs the transaction and accordingly displays the balance

The program should display the following options:
	1.	Open a savings bank account
	2.	Add a customer
	3.	Deposit money
	4.	Display sorted records
	5.	Close/delete account
